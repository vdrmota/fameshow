The Sponsor does not guarantee that the Prize can be made available to the winner.  The Prize is not assignable and not transferable and no substitutions are permitted.  In addition, if the Prize is unable to be fulfilled to the winner due to any applicable law, rule or regulation, or if the winner cannot claim the Prize for any reason, then Sponsor reserves the right to not award the Prize at all.  The winner shall be responsible and liable for all federal, state and local taxes on the value of the Prize.

<p>PRIZE SELECTION:</p>
<p>The winner of the Contest will be the last person remaining at the end of each game show match.  If there are multiple players remaining after the final question, such remaining players will split the Prize evenly. Sponsor may also offer &quot;The 1&quot; Contests.  In &quot;The 1&quot; Contests, which shall be clearly identified at the outset of the game show in which the contest is offered, players will continue to receive questions until only a single player is able to correctly answer the question given.  Sponsor will then award the Prize to the single remaining player.  If all remaining players fail to answer a question correctly, resulting in every player&#39;s elimination, the prize for &quot;The 1&quot; Contest will roll over to a future game, which will be announced live at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<p>The Contest will be conducted under the supervision of the Sponsor. The decisions of the Sponsor are final and binding in all matters relating to this Contest. The winner will be notified in the FAMESHOW Application or by email; provided, however, that Sponsor reserves the right to determine an alternate method of notification.  The winner must cash-out the Prize within 90 days after the date of notification of such Prize. A Contest winner&#39;s failure to cash-out the Prize within the specified 90 days will be considered such Contest winner&#39;s forfeiture of the Prize and Sponsor may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all. If an entrant is found to be ineligible, Sponsor may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all.</p>
